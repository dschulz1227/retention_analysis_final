This program was created to compare the values of fields entered by 3 different groups of individuals.

The three values derive from a Camera Check sheet, where each Server has it's owm row for a value to be entered. 
The value is the number of days the server holds camera retention data.

Each shift must fill out a form, checking every server. Then each shift's entries can be compared to one another with this program.

It uses an equation to determine the difference in the values. If there is a difference that meets certain requirements, an action will be taken.

# # # FUTURE # # #
- The plan is make a dictionary from each shift's form values. Where they can be stored and compared with other days' dictionaries. Giving the 
capability to compare short and long term data.
- We will be able to build long term tables to visualize the differences between servers and their values over time. The more time passes,
the more accurate the data can be.
- We will be able to analyze for patterns, configuring our equipment accordingly to optimize the capabilities of our surveillance system.
